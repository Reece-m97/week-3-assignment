# week-3-assignment

reflection
what did i achieve?
i focused on the functionality side for this project, which was a long rabbit hole and was fun to work on.
i learnt a lot trying to achieve my vision for the project like how to create modal windows and add statistics to the game.
normally i am not great at keeping things tidy but this time i made sure to keep everything in sections and add comments, as the code got longer and longer, i realised the importance of doing so.

what i did't achieve
i didn't get to use the api, as i already hard coded my upgrades bbefore the demo, i didnt know how to incorporate the api afterwards.
i also didn't get around to giving my upgrade buttons on the right sidebar any function as it was very advanced to double the existing efficiency of the cats, this is something i will continue to look into. i also wanted the background music to play when the page loads but i found great difficulty in this, i looked all over the internet to be able to achieve this and tried so many different methods but for some reason nothing worked, i could on get it to play muted and then you would have to manually unmute the music. i spiralled on this for the last couple of hours last night and ran out of time to amend my buttons.
as i focused on the javascript this asssignment, i lacked a little bit on the styling of the page and is something i would have liked to improve, such as including a background image and adding animations. i had the idea of having treats fall and pile up. adding animations is something i need to look into more.

so far this has been my favourite project to work on and looking forward to working on more backend focused projects.
